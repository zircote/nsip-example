# Crop Rotation Plan

## Market Garden Rotation Strategy

Our rotation improves soil health, breaks pest cycles, and optimizes yields in the market garden.

### Rotation Sequence (Garden Beds)

| Year | Bed Group A | Bed Group B | Bed Group C |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2025 | Nightshades | Legumes/roots | Greens/brassicas |
| 2026 | Greens/brassicas | Nightshades | Legumes/roots |
| 2027 | Legumes/roots | Greens/brassicas | Nightshades |

## Rotation Benefits

1. **Nitrogen fixation** — Legume beds add nitrogen for following crops
2. **Disease break** — Alternating families disrupts pest lifecycles
3. **Soil structure** — Root crops loosen soil for following greens
4. **Weed control** — Cover crops between seasons suppress weeds

## Pasture Management

- Rotational grazing with sheep across 6–8 paddocks
- Rest periods of 30–45 days per paddock
- Overseed thin areas in fall with clover mix
- Soil test pastures every 2 years

## Notes

- Cover crop all garden beds over winter (rye/vetch mix)
- Compost from poultry litter applied to garden beds annually
