# EOV Monitoring Plan — Epic Pastures

This document describes our ecological monitoring program: what we measure, where, when, and why.

## Why We Monitor

Monitoring tells us whether our land management — grazing rotations, cover cropping, riparian buffers — is actually improving the land. Without data, we're guessing. With data, we can make better decisions and eventually demonstrate regenerative outcomes for Savory Institute EOV enrollment.

## What We Monitor

### Short-Term Monitoring (STM) — Seasonal, Visual

Every season (4x/year), we walk each monitoring site and score 15 ecological health indicators:

| Category | Indicators |
|----------|-----------|
| **Plant Community** | Live canopy cover, warm season grasses, cool season grasses, forbs/legumes, trees/shrubs, desirable species, undesirable species |
| **Living Organisms** | Insects, earthworms, birds, wildlife activity |
| **Soil Surface** | Litter abundance, litter decomposition, dung decomposition, bare soil, soil capping |
| **Erosion** | Wind erosion, water erosion |

Each indicator is scored on a 5-point scale. The system converts scores to numbers and tracks trends.

### Long-Term Monitoring (LTM) — Periodic, Lab-Based

Every 3-5 years (or when budgets allow), we collect:

- **Soil samples** — Sent to a lab for organic matter, carbon, pH, Haney test, nutrient analysis
- **Water infiltration tests** — On-site measurement of how fast water soaks into the ground

## Where We Monitor

### Strata (Land Types)

| Stratum | Approximate Acreage | Description |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Pasture | 25 acres | Rotational grazing paddocks for sheep |
| Crop field | 8 acres | Market garden beds and seasonal plantings |
| Riparian zone | 5 acres | Creek buffers and wet areas |
| Woodlot | 7 acres | Wooded areas and windbreaks |

### Monitoring Sites

We maintain 12 STM sites spread across all strata, plus 3 LTM sites for soil and water testing. See [Site Map](./site-map.md) for the full list with locations.

**Site naming convention:**
- `P-##` = Pasture sites
- `C-##` = Crop field sites
- `R-##` = Riparian zone sites
- `W-##` = Woodlot sites

## When We Monitor

### Seasonal Schedule (STM)

| Season | Months | What to Look For |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Spring** | March-April | Green-up, soil moisture, returning wildlife, early weed pressure |
| **Summer** | June-July | Peak growth, heat stress, insect activity, grazing impact |
| **Fall** | September-October | Senescence, seed set, litter accumulation, prep for dormancy |
| **Winter** | December-January | Dormant conditions, erosion evidence, ground cover adequacy |

### Photo Points

Take photos at each site during every seasonal assessment. Stand in the same spot, face the same direction. The comparison over time is what tells the story.

### Soil Sampling and Water Testing (LTM)

- Soil samples: Collect during fall (consistent timing for comparability)
- Water infiltration: Test during spring when soil is moist but not saturated

## How to Record Observations

All monitoring data goes into GitHub Issues using the EOV templates:

1. **Site Assessment** — Use after walking a monitoring site each season
2. **Soil Sample** — Use when lab results come back
3. **Water Test** — Use after running an infiltration test
4. **Photo Point** — Use when taking seasonal photos

See the [runbooks](../docs/runbooks/) for step-by-step instructions.
