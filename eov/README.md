# Ecological Outcome Verification (EOV)

This folder contains ecological monitoring records and reference data for Epic Pastures farm.

## What Is EOV?

Ecological Outcome Verification is a framework developed by the Savory Institute to track whether land management practices are improving ecological health. It measures real outcomes — what's actually happening on the ground — rather than just tracking practices.

## Monitoring Overview

**Framework:** Savory Institute EOV (Short-Term + Long-Term Monitoring)
**Frequency:** Seasonal (4x/year for STM), every 5 years for LTM
**Coverage:** Pastures, crop fields, riparian zones, woodlots

## How Records Work

Monitoring data is recorded as GitHub Issues using the EOV issue templates:

- **Site Assessment** — Score 15 ecological health indicators at each site (seasonal)
- **Soil Sample** — Record soil lab results when they come back (periodic)
- **Water Test** — Record infiltration test results (periodic)
- **Photo Point** — Document what you see at photo monitoring points (seasonal)

The system tracks trends over time and flags changes automatically.
