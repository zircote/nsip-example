# EOV Outcome Goals — Epic Pastures

Farm-level ecological goals and targets. These guide our monitoring program and define what "improving" looks like for our land.

---

## Overall Goal

Demonstrate measurable ecological improvement across the whole farm, building toward Savory Institute EOV enrollment within 3 years.

---

## Specific Targets

### Soil Health

| Metric | Current Baseline | 1-Year Target | 3-Year Target |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Organic matter (%) | TBD | +0.2% increase | +0.5% increase |
| Soil respiration (mg CO2-C/kg) | TBD | Maintain or improve | >80 |
| Aggregate stability (%) | TBD | Maintain or improve | >50% |
| Haney score | TBD | >7 (acceptable) | >15 (good) |

### Water Cycle

| Metric | Current Baseline | 1-Year Target | 3-Year Target |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Infiltration rate (in/hr) | TBD | >1.0 (fair) | >2.0 (excellent) |
| Bare soil (%) | TBD | <25% at all sites | <10% at all sites |

### Biodiversity

| Metric | Current Baseline | 1-Year Target | 3-Year Target |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Living organisms score | TBD | Average or better | Good or better |
| Desirable species | TBD | Some or more | Many at most sites |
| Undesirable species | TBD | Some or fewer | Few at most sites |

### Plant Community

| Metric | Current Baseline | 1-Year Target | 3-Year Target |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Live canopy cover | TBD | Average or better | Good or better |
| Litter abundance | TBD | Moderate or better | Good at most sites |
| Litter decomposition | TBD | Moderate or better | Active at most sites |

### Erosion

| Metric | Current Baseline | 1-Year Target | 3-Year Target |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Wind erosion | TBD | Light or less | Minimal or none |
| Water erosion | TBD | Light or less | Minimal or none |
| Soil capping | TBD | Moderate or less | Minimal or none |

## Savory Institute Enrollment Readiness

To be eligible for EOV enrollment, we need:

- [ ] At least 1 full year of baseline monitoring data
- [ ] All STM sites assessed at least 4 times (once per season)
- [ ] At least 1 round of LTM soil sampling completed
- [ ] At least 1 round of water infiltration testing completed
- [ ] Photo points documented for all seasons at all sites
- [ ] Demonstrable improving or stable EHI trend
- [ ] Monitoring plan documented and followed consistently

**Target enrollment date:** Spring 2028

## How Goals Connect to Management

| Goal | Management Action |
|------|------------------|
| Reduce bare soil | Maintain ground cover through grazing management, cover crops |
| Improve infiltration | Build soil structure through root diversity, reduce compaction |
| Increase organic matter | Leave litter, manage grazing for recovery periods |
| Boost biodiversity | Multi-species grazing, pollinator strips, riparian plantings |
| Reduce erosion | Maintain cover, improve water infiltration, protect steep areas |

*These goals will be refined after the first year of baseline data. Targets should be reviewed annually and adjusted based on what the monitoring data shows.*
