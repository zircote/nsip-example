## Site Selection Notes

- STM sites are distributed across all land types to capture the range of conditions
- LTM sites overlap with STM sites so short-term and long-term data can be correlated
- All sites are marked with permanent stakes or posts for consistent repositioning
- GPS coordinates are approximate — use the physical markers on site
