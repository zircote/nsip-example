# Epic Pastures Farm — Your Guide to Using This System

Welcome! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about using Epic Pastures' digital record-keeping system. Think of it as your **farm notebook moved online** — except it never gets lost, never gets rained on, and can do some of the math for you.

Don't worry if computers aren't your thing. We wrote this guide with you in mind. Every step is spelled out, and there's no rush. You can always come back to this page if you get lost.

## What Is This, Exactly?

This system lives on a website called **GitHub**. You can think of GitHub as a shared, online filing cabinet where the whole farm team can:

- **Write things down** (breeding records, health observations, equipment notes)
- **Find things later** (search by animal, date, field, or topic)
- **Get automatic help** (the system can look up sheep genetics for you)

You don't need to install anything on your computer. You just need a web browser (like Safari, Chrome, or Firefox) and your login.

## How to Get to the Farm System

1. Open your web browser (the app you use to go on the internet)
2. Go to: **github.com** and sign in with the username and password your farm manager gave you
3. Once signed in, look for **"nsip-example"** in your list of projects — or ask your farm manager for the direct link
4. You're in! You should see folders like `crops/`, `livestock/`, `equipment/`, and `compliance/`

## What's Where? (The Filing System)

Just like a real filing cabinet has drawers and folders, this system is organized into sections:

| Section | What's Inside |
|---|---|
| **crops/** | Planting schedules, crop rotation plans, soil test results |
| **livestock/** | Animal head counts, feeding schedules, health records, vet visit logs |
| **equipment/** | Equipment list, maintenance history, safety inspection results |
| **compliance/** | Permits, certifications, grant tracking, government program records |
| **eov/** | Ecological monitoring data, site maps, and land health goals |
| **docs/** | This guide and step-by-step instructions (runbooks) for common tasks |

To open any section, just **click on the folder name**. To go back, click the project name at the top of the page.

## The Two Main Things You'll Do

Almost everything on this system boils down to two activities:

### 1. Reading Information

This is the easy part. Click on any folder, then click on any file to read it. It's like opening a document. The information is displayed right on the screen — no downloading required.

### 2. Creating a Record (Called an "Issue")

When you need to write something down — a breeding event, a health observation, an equipment problem — you create what GitHub calls an **"Issue."** Don't let the name throw you off. An "issue" here is just a **form you fill out**. Think of it like filling out a paper form at the vet's office, except it's on screen.

**We have step-by-step runbooks for each type of record.** See the list below.

## What Are LPNs?

You'll see the letters **LPN** mentioned a lot in the sheep-related forms. LPN stands for **Local Production Number** — it's the ear tag number or ID number you use to identify each sheep on your farm.

When a form asks for "Sire LPN," it wants the **ram's ID number**. When it asks for "Dam LPN," it wants the **ewe's ID number**.

## What Happens After You Submit a Record?

For sheep breeding records (matings, lambings, weanings, and health), something helpful happens automatically:

1. You fill out and submit the form
2. The system looks up your animals in the **National Sheep Improvement Program (NSIP)** database
3. It adds a comment to your record with useful genetic information — things like growth potential, maternal traits, and whether a mating is safe from an inbreeding standpoint
4. The record gets a green **"enriched"** label so you know the extra information has been added

**You don't need to do anything extra for this.** It happens on its own. Just check back on your record later and you'll see the added information.

## Labels (The Colored Tags)

You'll notice colored tags on records. These are **labels** that help organize things — just like putting colored sticky tabs on pages in a binder. Here's what the colors and names mean:

**Farm area labels:**

| Label | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **crops** (green) | Related to crops and fields |
| **livestock** (brown) | Related to animals |
| **equipment** (dark gray) | Related to machinery and tools |
| **compliance** (purple) | Related to permits, grants, certifications |

**Priority labels:**

| Label | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **urgent** (red) | Needs attention right away |
| **routine** (green) | Regular, non-emergency task |
| **seasonal** (gold) | Tied to a specific time of year |

**Status labels (what's holding things up):**

| Label | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **waiting-on-vet** (pink) | Waiting for the veterinarian |
| **waiting-on-parts** (amber) | Waiting for a part to arrive |
| **waiting-on-weather** (light blue) | Can't do it until weather cooperates |
| **needs-review** (purple) | Ready for someone to look over |

**Breeding record labels (you'll see these on sheep records):**

| Label | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **record:mating** (green) | A breeding/mating record |
| **record:lambing** (blue) | A birth record |
| **record:health** (red) | A health observation or treatment |
| **record:weaning** (gold) | Weaning weight records |
| **record:sale** (purple) | An animal sale or transfer record |
| **record:death** (dark gray) | A death or culling record |
| **enriched** (teal) | Genetic data has been added to this record |
| **flock-action** (dark blue) | An automated flock analysis request |

## Tracking Land Health (EOV)

In addition to livestock and crop records, this system also tracks the **ecological health** of your land — whether the soil, water, plants, and wildlife are getting healthier over time.

This is called **EOV** (Ecological Outcome Verification), and it's a way to prove that your farming practices are actually regenerating the land. Think of it as a **report card for your soil and pastures**.

### What You'll Record

| Record Type | What It's For | How Often |
|---|---|---|
| **Site Assessment** | Walk a monitoring site and score what you see (plant cover, soil condition, wildlife) | 4 times a year (each season) |
| **Soil Sample** | Enter soil lab results when they come back | Every few years |
| **Water Test** | Record how fast water soaks into the ground | Every few years |
| **Photo Point** | Take a photo at a monitoring site to track visual changes | 4 times a year |

### What Happens Automatically

Just like with sheep records, the system adds helpful information after you submit an EOV record:

- It **compares your scores** to previous visits at the same site
- It shows whether each indicator is **improving, stable, or declining**
- It calculates an overall **Ecological Health Index** for the site

### Why It Matters

Tracking ecological health can:
- Show you which management practices are actually working
- Help you decide where to focus improvements
- Build a track record for Savory Institute certification (if the farm pursues it)
- Open doors to premium markets that want proof of regenerative practices

### Getting Started

The monitoring sites are marked with posts around the farm. See the [site map](../eov/site-map.md) for locations. The runbooks below walk you through each type of record:

- [Recording a Site Assessment](runbooks/recording-a-site-assessment.md)
- [Recording a Soil Sample](runbooks/recording-a-soil-sample.md)
- [Recording a Water Test](runbooks/recording-a-water-test.md)
- [Requesting an EOV Analysis](runbooks/requesting-an-eov-analysis.md)

## A Few Reassurances

- **You can't break anything.** Creating a record doesn't change any other records. If you make a mistake, you can edit it or ask your farm manager to help fix it.
- **Nothing is truly deleted.** Even if you close a record, it's still there and searchable. Think of "closing" a record like putting a folder back in the cabinet — it's filed away but not thrown out.
- **You don't need to understand the genetics.** The system adds genetic data automatically. If the numbers don't mean anything to you yet, that's completely fine. Your farm manager or breeding advisor can help interpret them.
- **Take your time.** There's no timer. You can start filling out a form, walk away, and come back to it.
