# The Weekly Farm Checklist

Every Monday morning, the system automatically creates a checklist to help the farm team stay on top of routine tasks. You don't need to do anything to make this happen — it just shows up.

## Where to Find It

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

Click on **"Issues"** at the top of the project page.

### Step 2 — Look for This Week's Checklist

Every Monday, a new record appears at the top of the list with a title like **"Weekly Farm Checklist"** and the current date. Click on it to open it.

## What's on the Checklist

The weekly checklist typically includes reminders like:

- **Livestock**: Check water systems, inspect fencing, review any open health records
- **Crops**: Scout fields for pests/weeds, check irrigation if applicable
- **Equipment**: Review upcoming maintenance, check fluid levels on active equipment
- **Compliance**: Note any upcoming deadlines for permits, reports, or certifications
- **Records**: Follow up on any open records that need closing or updating

## How to Use It

Think of this checklist as a shared to-do list for the week. As you complete items:

1. You can check off items by clicking the checkbox next to each task (if the checklist uses checkboxes)
2. Or you can leave a comment at the bottom noting what you've done: "Walked the fence line on the north pasture — all good"
3. At the end of the week, the farm manager or team lead can close the checklist

**You don't have to complete every item yourself.** The checklist is for the whole team. Just handle what's in your area.

## What If I Miss a Week?

Nothing bad happens. The old checklist stays there (you can find it under Closed issues), and a new one appears the following Monday. It's a reminder system, not a test — no one's keeping score.

## Can I Add Items to the Checklist?

Yes! If you think of something that should be done this week:

1. Open this week's checklist
2. Scroll to the bottom
3. Leave a comment with what you'd like to add: "Reminder: salt blocks in the south pasture need replacing"
4. Click **"Comment"**

## Tips

- Check the weekly issue first thing Monday morning — it's a good way to start the week with a plan
- If a task from the checklist turns into a bigger job (like discovering a broken fence that needs real repair), create a separate record for it using the appropriate form. That way the repair gets its own tracking
- The checklist is also a handy record of what was happening on the farm each week. Months from now, you can look back and see what you were working on
