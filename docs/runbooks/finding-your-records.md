# Finding Your Records

Use this guide when you need to look up an old record — a past breeding event, a health treatment, an equipment repair, or anything else that was previously entered into the system.

## The Quick Way (Search)

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

Click on **"Issues"** at the top of the project page.

### Step 2 — Use the Search Box

At the top of the Issues list, you'll see a search box. It might already have some text in it like `is:issue is:open`. That's fine.

### Step 3 — Type What You're Looking For

Click in the search box and type your search term. You can search by:

- **Animal ID number** — Type the LPN: `12345`
- **Keywords** — Type a word: `limping` or `foot rot` or `hydraulic`
- **Equipment name** — Type: `tractor` or `mower`
- **Field name** — Type: `Field 2`

Then press **Enter** on your keyboard.

### Step 4 — Browse the Results

You'll see a list of matching records. Click on any one to read the full details.

## Seeing All Records of One Type

If you want to see, for example, all mating records or all health records, you can filter by label:

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

### Step 2 — Click on "Labels"

You'll see a **"Labels"** button near the top of the list. Click it.

### Step 3 — Pick the Label You Want

Click on any label to see all records with that tag. For example:

- Click **"record:mating"** to see all mating records
- Click **"record:lambing"** to see all lambing records
- Click **"livestock"** to see everything related to animals
- Click **"urgent"** to see anything marked urgent

## Seeing Closed (Finished) Records

By default, the Issues tab shows only **open** records — things that are still active or unresolved. To see records that have been closed (finished, resolved, or archived):

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

### Step 2 — Click "Closed"

Near the top of the list, you'll see two tabs: **Open** and **Closed**. Click **"Closed"** to see finished records.

You can also search within closed records the same way — just type your search term after switching to the Closed view.

## Finding a Specific Animal's Complete History

To see everything recorded about one animal:

1. Go to the Issues tab
2. In the search box, clear any existing text
3. Type the animal's ID number (LPN)
4. Press Enter

This will show you every record that mentions that animal — matings, lambings, health events, weaning weights, and more. It's like pulling that animal's entire file from the cabinet.

## Reading Farm Information (Not Records)

If you're looking for reference information — like the feeding schedule, the planting plan, or the equipment inventory — that's not in Issues. It's in the main file folders:

1. Go to the main page of the project (click the project name at the very top)
2. Click on the folder you want:
   - **crops/** for planting schedules, rotation plans, soil tests
   - **livestock/** for feeding schedules, herd numbers, vet logs
   - **equipment/** for equipment lists, maintenance logs, safety inspections
   - **compliance/** for permits, certifications, grants
3. Click on the file name to read it

## Tips

- **Bookmark the Issues page.** If you use this system regularly, save the Issues page as a bookmark in your browser so you can get to it with one click
- **Search is forgiving.** You don't need exact spelling. If you search "limp" it will find records with "limping," "limped," etc.
- **Can't find what you're looking for?** Try different search terms. If searching the animal's ID doesn't work, try the condition ("foot rot"), the date, or the treatment ("penicillin")
- **Ask for help.** If you're stuck, your farm manager can help you find what you need. There's no such thing as a silly question when it comes to computers
