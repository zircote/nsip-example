# Reporting an Equipment Problem

Use this guide when a piece of equipment needs repair, maintenance, or inspection — or when something just doesn't seem right.

## What You'll Need Before You Start

- **Which piece of equipment** (tractor, combine, sprayer, etc.)
- **What happened or what you noticed**
- **When** it happened or when you noticed it
- **How urgent** it is

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

Click on **"Issues"** at the top of the project page.

### Step 2 — Start a New Report

Click the green **"New issue"** button.

### Step 3 — Choose the Equipment Maintenance Form

Find **"Equipment Maintenance"** and click **"Get started"**.

### Step 4 — Fill In the Form

- **Title** — Keep it simple: "Tractor hydraulic leak" or "Combine belt needs replacement" or "Mower won't start"
- **Equipment** — Which machine (e.g., John Deere 6120M, Case IH 7150, Kubota ZD1211)
- **Date** — When you noticed the issue
- **Description** — What's going on, in your own words:
  - "Noticed a puddle of hydraulic fluid under the tractor after parking it in the shed"
  - "The PTO makes a grinding noise when engaged"
  - "Due for regular oil change — 500 hours showing"
- **Priority**:
  - **Routine** — Regular maintenance, no rush
  - **Urgent** — Something is broken and we need it soon
  - **Seasonal** — Needs to be done before the next season (pre-harvest, pre-planting, etc.)
- **Notes** — Anything else: "I shut it down right away," "This happened last year too," "Parts might need to be ordered"

### Step 5 — Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button.

### Step 6 — You're Done!

The equipment lead will be notified. If parts need to be ordered, the record will get a "waiting-on-parts" label so everyone knows the status.

## Tracking the Repair

Once your report is submitted, you and the team can use it to track progress:

- **Comments** — Anyone can add updates: "Ordered the belt, should arrive Thursday," "Fixed the leak, was a loose fitting"
- **Labels** — The status label will update as things progress:
  - `waiting-on-parts` — Parts have been ordered
  - `needs-review` — Someone needs to look at it
  - No special label — Ready to work on or already done
- **Closing the record** — When the repair is finished, someone will close the record. It's still searchable if you need to look it up later

## Tips

- **Report it, even if it's small.** A small leak today can be a big repair bill next month. Writing it down means it won't be forgotten
- **Include the hour meter reading** if you can see it. This helps track maintenance intervals
- **If something is dangerous** (brake failure, structural crack, fuel leak), tell someone in person immediately AND create the record. Safety first — the record can wait a few minutes
- **If you're not sure what the equipment is called**, just describe it. "The big green tractor" or "the riding mower" works fine — someone will know what you mean
