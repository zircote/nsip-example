# Recording a Sale or Transfer

Use this guide when an animal leaves your flock — whether sold, transferred to another farm, or moved out for any other reason.

---

## What You'll Need Before You Start

- The **animal's ID number** (ear tag or LPN)
- The **date** of the sale or transfer
- **Who bought the animal** (if applicable)
- The **sale price** (optional)

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

At the top of the project page, click on **"Issues"**.

### Step 2 — Start a New Record

Click the green **"New issue"** button.

### Step 3 — Choose the Sale Record Form

Find **"Sale Record"** in the list and click **"Get started"**.

### Step 4 — Fill In the Form

- **Animal LPN ID** — The animal's ID number
- **Sale Date** — When the animal left (example: `2026-09-15`)
- **Sale Type** — Pick one from the dropdown:
  - Private treaty (sold directly to another farmer)
  - Auction (sold at a livestock auction)
  - Stud sale (sold as breeding stock at a stud sale)
  - Transfer (no sale) (moved to another farm without a sale, like a loan or gift)
- **Buyer Name** — Who bought the animal (optional)
- **Destination Flock** — The flock or farm the animal is going to, if you know (optional)
- **Sale Price** — What you got for the animal (optional)
- **Notes** — Anything else worth recording: "Top-performing ewe, sold as breeding stock," "Buyer asked about her lambing history"

### Step 5 — Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button.

### Step 6 — You're Done!

The system will automatically look up the animal's complete genetic profile and add it as a comment. This gives you a permanent record of the animal's genetics — useful if the buyer asks questions later or if you want to remember what you sold.

---

## What the Automatic Comment Will Tell You

- **Full genetic profile** — All of the animal's breeding values and index scores
- **Pedigree** — The animal's parents and grandparents
- **Key indexes** — Overall merit scores that summarize the animal's genetic value

This information stays in your records even after the animal is gone.

## Tips

- Recording sales helps you track which genetics have left your flock and where they went
- If you sell several animals to the same buyer on the same day, create a separate record for each animal. This keeps the genetics searchable per animal
- The notes field is a good place to record why you sold the animal — this helps when reviewing flock decisions later
