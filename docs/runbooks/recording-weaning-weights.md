# Recording Weaning Weights

Use this guide when you weigh lambs at weaning time (typically around 60-90 days of age) and want to log the results.

---

## What You'll Need Before You Start

- The **date** you weighed the lambs
- Each lamb's **ID number** (ear tag or LPN)
- Each lamb's **weight**

It helps to write everything down on paper at the scale first, then enter it into the system when you're back at the computer.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

At the top of the project page, click on **"Issues"**.

### Step 2 — Start a New Record

Click the green **"New issue"** button.

### Step 3 — Choose the Weaning Record Form

Find **"Weaning Record"** in the list and click **"Get started"**.

### Step 4 — Fill In the Form

- **Weaning Date** — The date you weighed them (example: `2026-07-01`)
- **Animals and Weights** — List each lamb with its ID and weight. Put each one on its own line, like this:
  ```
  LPN 11111: 65 lbs
  LPN 22222: 72 lbs
  LPN 33333: 58 lbs
  LPN 44444: 70 lbs
  ```
- **Notes** — Anything worth noting: "All lambs in good condition," "LPN 33333 recovered from scours last month," etc.

### Step 5 — Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button.

### Step 6 — You're Done!

The system will automatically look up each lamb's genetic data and rank them by their weaning weight genetics. This helps you see which lambs are growing well because of good genetics (not just because they had less competition for milk).

## What the Automatic Comment Will Tell You

- **Ranking** — Your lambs ranked by their genetic weaning weight score (called WWT EBV). The ones at the top have the best growth genetics
- **Breed percentiles** — How each lamb's growth compares to others of the same breed across the country
- **Standouts** — Lambs that are significantly above or below average, which helps with selection decisions

## Why This Matters

Weaning weight is one of the most important measurements in sheep farming. It tells you:

- Which ewes are raising the heaviest lambs (good mothers)
- Which rams are producing fast-growing offspring (good genetics)
- Which lambs might be your best keepers for the breeding flock

The genetic scores help you separate the lambs that grew well because of **genetics** from those that grew well because of **luck** (fewer siblings, more milk, etc.).

## Tips

- Weigh all the lambs in a group on the same day if possible. This makes the comparison fair
- Record the weights as soon as you can after weighing — even a quick, rough entry is better than nothing
- If you weigh lambs in multiple batches (different days), create a separate record for each batch with the correct date
- Don't stress about perfect weights. Close enough is fine — the genetics work even with approximate numbers
