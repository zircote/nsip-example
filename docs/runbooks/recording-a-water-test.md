# Recording a Water Infiltration Test

Use this guide after you've run a water infiltration test and want to record the results. An infiltration test measures how fast water soaks into the ground — it's one of the best indicators of soil health.

## What You'll Need Before You Start

- The **site ID** where you did the test (like P-01 or C-01)
- The **date** of the test
- The **infiltration rate** (how many inches of water per hour soaked in)
- Optionally: the ring size you used, time to steady state, and soil moisture conditions

## A Quick Primer: What's an Infiltration Test?

If you haven't done one before, here's the basic idea:

1. Push a metal ring into the ground
2. Pour a known amount of water into the ring
3. Time how long it takes to soak in
4. Calculate the rate (inches per hour)

Healthy soil soaks up water like a sponge. Compacted or unhealthy soil lets water sit on top and run off. The faster water soaks in, the better your soil structure.

Your farm advisor can show you the full test procedure if you haven't done it before.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

At the top of the project page, click on **"Issues"**.

### Step 2 — Start a New Record

Click the green **"New issue"** button.

### Step 3 — Choose the Water Test Form

Find **"EOV Water Infiltration Test"** in the list and click **"Get started"**.

### Step 4 — Fill In the Form

- **Site ID** — Where you did the test (like `P-01`)
- **Test Date** — When you did it (like `2026-04-10`)
- **Land Type** — What kind of land
- **Infiltration Rate** — The number you calculated (like `1.5` for 1.5 inches/hour)
- **Time to Steady State** — How many minutes until the rate stabilized (if you tracked this)
- **Ring Diameter** — Size of the ring you used (if applicable)
- **Soil Moisture Before Test** — Was the ground dry, moist, wet, or saturated?
- **Days Since Last Rain** — Roughly how long since it rained

### Step 5 — Add Notes (Optional)

Any observations about soil type, texture, or conditions during the test.

### Step 6 — Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button.

## What Happens Next

The system will:
1. Compare your rate to previous tests at the same site
2. Rate your result against benchmarks (see below)
3. Show whether infiltration is improving over time
4. Add the **"eov-enriched"** label when done

## What the Numbers Mean

| Infiltration Rate | Rating | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| Less than 0.5 in/hr | Poor | Soil is compacted — water runs off instead of soaking in |
| 0.5 to 1.0 in/hr | Fair | Some absorption, but there's room for improvement |
| 1.0 to 2.0 in/hr | Good | Healthy soil structure — water is getting where it needs to go |
| More than 2.0 in/hr | Excellent | Very healthy soil — water soaks right in like a sponge |

## Tips

- **Test when soil is moist but not saturated** — Spring is often ideal
- **Same spot helps** — Test near your monitoring site marker for consistency
- **Do 3 tests per site** if time allows, and average the results for a more reliable number
- **Don't test right after rain** — Wait 2-3 days for a fair reading
- **Improving infiltration is one of the best signs** that your land management is working
