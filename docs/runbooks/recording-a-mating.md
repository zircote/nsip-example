# Recording a Mating (Breeding Event)

Use this guide whenever you pair a ram (sire) with a ewe (dam) and want to write it down in the system.

---

## What You'll Need Before You Start

- The **ram's ID number** (his ear tag or LPN)
- The **ewe's ID number** (her ear tag or LPN)
- The **date** you put them together
- Whether this was **natural breeding**, **artificial insemination (AI)**, or **embryo transfer**

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

At the top of the project page, you'll see several tabs (Code, Issues, Pull requests, etc.). Click on **"Issues"**.

### Step 2 — Start a New Record

Click the green **"New issue"** button on the right side of the page.

### Step 3 — Choose the Mating Record Form

You'll see a list of different forms. Find the one that says **"Mating Record"** and click **"Get started"** next to it.

### Step 4 — Fill In the Form

The form has these fields:

- **Sire LPN ID** — Type the ram's ID number (example: `500123`)
- **Dam LPN ID** — Type the ewe's ID number (example: `500456`)
- **Mating Date** — Enter the date (example: `2026-03-15` for March 15, 2026)
- **Breeding Method** — Pick one from the dropdown:
  - Natural
  - Artificial Insemination
  - Embryo Transfer
- **Notes** — (Optional) Add anything else worth noting, like "First breeding for this ewe" or "Ram seemed lethargic"

### Step 5 — Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button at the bottom of the form.

### Step 6 — You're Done!

Your mating record is now saved. Within a few minutes, the system will automatically:

1. Look up both animals in the national sheep database
2. Check whether this pairing is safe from an inbreeding standpoint
3. Add a comment to your record with the results

You can come back to this record anytime by going to the Issues tab and clicking on it.

## What the Automatic Comment Will Tell You

After the system processes your record, you'll see a comment added that includes:

- **Inbreeding check** — A color-coded rating:
  - **Green** = Safe pairing, low risk of inbreeding problems
  - **Yellow** = Some shared ancestry, discuss with your breeding advisor
  - **Red** = Close relatives, consider a different pairing
- **Sire traits** — The ram's genetic strengths and weaknesses (growth rate, carcass quality, etc.)
- **Dam traits** — The ewe's genetic strengths and weaknesses (milk, mothering, etc.)
- **Comparison** — A side-by-side look at how the two animals complement each other
- **Alternative sire suggestions** — Other rams in the database that might also be good matches for this ewe

## If Something Doesn't Look Right

- **Wrong ID number?** Click the three dots (**...**) at the top right of your record and select "Edit" to fix it
- **No automatic comment appeared after 10 minutes?** The system might be busy. Check back in an hour. If it's still missing, let your farm manager know
- **The inbreeding check came back red?** Don't panic. The mating record is just a record — it doesn't control what happens in the barn. Talk to your breeding advisor about whether to proceed or try a different ram

## Tips

- Record matings as they happen, or at the end of each day. The sooner you write them down, the less likely you are to forget details
- If you're breeding multiple ewes to the same ram, you'll create a separate record for each ewe
- The "Notes" field is a great place to jot down things you'd normally write on a sticky note — pen markings, ram behavior, weather conditions, anything that might matter later
