# Recording a Health Observation

Use this guide when you notice something about an animal's health — illness, injury, treatment, or just something that doesn't look right — and want to write it down.

---

## What You'll Need Before You Start

- The **animal's ID number** (ear tag or LPN)
- The **date** you noticed the issue or gave the treatment
- A **short description** of what you observed or did
- The **treatment** given, if any (medicine name, dose, method)

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

At the top of the project page, click on **"Issues"**.

### Step 2 — Start a New Record

Click the green **"New issue"** button.

### Step 3 — Choose the Health Record Form

Find **"Health Record"** in the list and click **"Get started"**.

### Step 4 — Fill In the Form

- **Animal LPN** — The animal's ID number
- **Date Observed** — When you noticed the issue or gave treatment (example: `2026-05-20`)
- **Condition** — What you observed. Be as plain as you like:
  - "Limping on front right"
  - "Runny nose, off feed"
  - "Routine CDT booster"
  - "Foot rot, left rear"
  - "Diarrhea, mild"
- **Treatment** — What you did about it (leave blank if you're just noting an observation):
  - "Penicillin 5cc IM"
  - "Trimmed hooves, applied zinc sulfate"
  - "Moved to sick pen for monitoring"
  - "Called vet, appointment Thursday"
- **Severity** — Pick one:
  - Observation (just noting something)
  - Minor (animal is functional but needs attention)
  - Moderate (animal needs treatment soon)
  - Severe (needs immediate vet attention)
- **Notes** — Anything else: "First time this animal has had this issue," "Third sheep in south pasture with same symptoms this week"

### Step 5 — Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button.

### Step 6 — You're Done!

For sheep, the system will look up the animal's genetic profile and add it as a comment. This includes traits related to parasite resistance and overall hardiness, which can be useful context when patterns emerge.

## When to Use This Form

Use it for **anything health-related**, including:

- Illness or injury you noticed
- Treatments you gave (even routine ones like deworming or vaccinations)
- Follow-up observations ("Checked LPN 12345, still limping but eating well")
- Vet visit notes
- Death (there's also a separate form specifically for recording deaths, if you prefer)

The point is to build a history for each animal. If you're ever standing in the barn wondering "has this ewe had foot problems before?" you can search her ID number and find out.

## Following Up on a Health Record

If you need to add an update to an existing health record (for example, "gave second dose of antibiotic three days later"):

1. Go to the Issues tab
2. Find the original record (search for the animal's ID number)
3. Click on it
4. Scroll to the bottom where it says "Leave a comment"
5. Type your update
6. Click the green **"Comment"** button

This keeps all the information about one health event together in one place.

## Tips

- Don't wait for something to be "serious enough" to record. Even small observations can reveal patterns over time
- If you treated multiple animals for the same thing on the same day, you can either create one record per animal, or create one record and list all the animals. One per animal is easier to search later, but either way works
- Write treatments the way you'd tell someone else about them: "Gave 5cc penicillin in the muscle, left hip." You don't need fancy medical terms
- If the vet visits, ask them to tell you what they did and write it down in your own words. It doesn't have to be perfect — what matters is that it's recorded
