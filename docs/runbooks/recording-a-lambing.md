# Recording a Lambing (Birth)

Use this guide when a ewe gives birth and you want to log the details.

---

## What You'll Need Before You Start

- The **ewe's ID number** (her ear tag or LPN)
- The **date** the lambs were born
- **How many lambs** were born
- **How many lambs** are alive (sometimes these numbers differ)
- **Birth weights** of each lamb (if you weighed them)
- The **sex** of each lamb (ram lamb or ewe lamb)
- Any notes about how the birth went

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

At the top of the project page, click on **"Issues"**.

### Step 2 — Start a New Record

Click the green **"New issue"** button.

### Step 3 — Choose the Lambing Record Form

Find **"Lambing Record"** in the list and click **"Get started"**.

### Step 4 — Fill In the Form

- **Dam LPN ID** — Type the ewe's ID number (the mother)
- **Sire LPN ID** — The ram's ID number, if you know it (optional)
- **Lambing Date** — The date the lambs arrived (example: `2026-04-10`)
- **Number Born** — Total lambs delivered (including any that didn't survive)
- **Number Born Alive** — How many are alive and well
- **Lamb Details** — Enter each lamb's sex and birth weight. Put each one on its own line, like this:
  ```
  Ewe: 4.2 kg
  Ram: 4.8 kg
  ```
  If you weigh in pounds, you can write that instead (e.g., `Ewe: 9.2 lbs`). Either way is fine.
- **Lambing Ease Score** — Pick from the dropdown:
  - 1 - Unassisted (ewe did it on her own)
  - 2 - Minor assistance (needed a little help)
  - 3 - Moderate assistance (some hands-on help needed)
  - 4 - Significant assistance (difficult delivery)
  - 5 - Veterinary intervention (vet had to help)
- **Notes** — Anything worth remembering: "Ewe cleaned lambs quickly," "Lamb 2 was slow to stand," "Delivered in the south pen"

### Step 5 — Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button.

### Step 6 — You're Done!

Your lambing record is saved. The system will automatically look up the ewe's genetic profile and add useful context — like her expected litter size based on her genetics and breed averages.

## What the Automatic Comment Will Tell You

- **Dam's lambing traits** — Her genetic score for number of lambs born and number weaned. Higher numbers generally mean she's genetically inclined toward bigger litters and better lamb survival
- **Breed context** — How her scores compare to the breed average
- **Pedigree** — Her parents and grandparents, if available in the database

## Tips

- Try to record lambings the same day they happen. Memory fades fast during a busy lambing season
- If you don't have a scale handy, it's better to estimate the weight and note "estimated" than to leave it blank
- If a lamb dies within the first 24 hours, update the record in the Notes field. This information is valuable for tracking ewe performance over time
- For triplets or more, just list each lamb on its own line in the Birth Weights field
