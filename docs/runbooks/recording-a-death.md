# Recording a Death or Culling

Use this guide when an animal dies or is culled (removed from the flock for performance or structural reasons).

Recording deaths and culls is important, even though it's not the most pleasant task. It helps you spot patterns (like repeated predation losses in one pasture) and preserves the animal's genetic record for reference.

## What You'll Need Before You Start

- The **animal's ID number** (ear tag or LPN)
- The **date** of death or culling
- The **cause** (disease, predation, age, culled, etc.)

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

At the top of the project page, click on **"Issues"**.

### Step 2 — Start a New Record

Click the green **"New issue"** button.

### Step 3 — Choose the Death/Cull Record Form

Find **"Death/Cull Record"** in the list and click **"Get started"**.

### Step 4 — Fill In the Form

- **Animal LPN ID** — The animal's ID number
- **Date** — When the animal died or was culled (example: `2026-06-10`)
- **Cause** — Pick the closest match from the dropdown:
  - Disease
  - Predation
  - Age
  - Culled - structural (removed due to physical conformation issues)
  - Culled - performance (removed due to poor production)
  - Accident
  - Other
- **Age at Death** — How old the animal was (example: `4 years`). Optional but helpful
- **Notes** — Any details that might be useful later: "Found in south pasture, possible coyote," "Chronic foot problems, decided to cull," "Necropsy showed pneumonia"

### Step 5 — Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button.

### Step 6 — You're Done!

The system will automatically archive the animal's complete genetic profile and check whether the animal has any living offspring in your flock. This information is preserved permanently as part of your flock records.

## What the Automatic Comment Will Tell You

- **Complete genetic profile** — A final snapshot of the animal's breeding values and index scores
- **Living offspring** — A list of any lambs or descendants still in your flock that carry this animal's genetics
- **Pedigree** — The animal's family tree for reference

## Why Record Deaths and Culls?

- **Spot patterns** — If multiple animals die from the same cause, that's something you need to know
- **Track culling decisions** — Looking back at why you culled animals helps refine your selection criteria
- **Preserve genetics** — Even though the animal is gone, its genetics live on in its offspring. Knowing the parent's profile helps evaluate the offspring
- **Accurate flock counts** — Your flock records stay accurate when departures are logged

## Tips

- Record deaths as soon as practical. Details fade quickly
- Be honest about the cause. The records are for your benefit, not for judgment. Accurate data leads to better decisions
- If a necropsy (animal autopsy) is performed, summarize the findings in the Notes field
- For culling decisions, note what specifically led to the decision. "Poor feet" or "Failed to raise lambs two years in a row" is the kind of detail that helps when reviewing genetics later
