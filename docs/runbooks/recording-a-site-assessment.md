# Recording a Site Assessment

Use this guide when you walk a monitoring site and want to record what you see. This is the main EOV record — you'll do this 4 times a year at each monitoring site.

Don't worry about getting scores exactly right. The system tracks trends over time, so small differences don't matter as much as the overall direction. Just record what you honestly observe.

## What You'll Need Before You Start

- The **site ID** (the label on the post at your monitoring site, like P-01 or C-02)
- The **date** of your visit
- Your **eyes** — that's really it. You're scoring what you see

## Steps

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

At the top of the project page, click on **"Issues"**.

### Step 2 — Start a New Record

Click the green **"New issue"** button on the right side of the page.

### Step 3 — Choose the Site Assessment Form

Find **"EOV Site Assessment"** in the list and click **"Get started"**.

### Step 4 — Fill In the Basic Information

- **Site ID** — Type the site label (like `P-01` or `R-02`)
- **Assessment Date** — Enter today's date (like `2026-06-15`)
- **Season** — Pick the current season from the dropdown
- **Land Type** — Pick what kind of land this site is on

### Step 5 — Score the Indicators

Now comes the heart of it. For each indicator, pick the option that best describes what you see **right now at this site**. Here's a plain-language guide:

**Live Canopy Cover** — Look down. How much of the ground is covered by living plants?
- Poor = mostly bare ground with scattered plants
- Excellent = ground is almost completely covered by living plants

**Living Organisms** — Look around. Do you see bugs, birds, earthworms, or other creatures?
- None observed = quiet, no visible wildlife
- Very abundant = lots of activity — insects buzzing, birds calling, earthworms in soil

**Warm Season Grasses / Cool Season Grasses** — How do the grasses look?
- Absent = you don't see any of this type
- Thriving = healthy, vigorous, growing well

**Forbs and Legumes** — Non-grass plants (wildflowers, clover, etc.)
- Same scale: Absent to Thriving

**Trees and Shrubs** — If there are woody plants at this site, how do they look?
- Same scale: Absent to Thriving

**Desirable Species** — Plants you'd like to see more of
- None = can't spot any good plants
- Dominant = the good plants are taking over (that's great!)

**Undesirable Species** — Weeds and invasives
- Dominant = weeds are everywhere (not great)
- None = no weeds to speak of (great!)

**Litter Abundance** — Dead plant material lying on the ground (natural mulch)
- None = bare ground, no dead plant material
- Heavy = thick layer of dead material covering the ground

**Litter Decomposition** — Is the dead stuff breaking down?
- None = old dead material just sitting there
- Rapid = material is actively breaking down and turning into soil

**Dung Decomposition** — If there's animal manure, is it being broken down?
- None = manure sitting on surface unchanged
- Rapid = manure being actively broken down by insects and microbes

**Bare Soil** — How much bare ground do you see?
- >75% = almost all bare ground (concerning)
- <10% = very little bare ground (excellent)

**Soil Capping** — Is the soil surface hard and crusty?
- Severe = thick crust everywhere
- None = soft, crumbly soil surface

**Wind Erosion / Water Erosion** — Any signs of soil being blown or washed away?
- Severe = obvious erosion damage
- None = no signs of erosion

**Photo Taken?** — Did you take a photo at this spot?

### Step 6 — Add Notes (Optional)

Jot down anything else worth remembering — weather conditions, recent grazing, anything unusual.

### Step 7 — Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button.

## What Happens Next

Within a few minutes, the system will automatically:

1. Convert your scores into numbers and calculate an **Ecological Health Index (EHI)** for this site
2. If you've assessed this site before, compare your new scores to the previous ones
3. Add a comment showing **which indicators are improving, stable, or declining**
4. Add a green **"eov-enriched"** label so you know the analysis is done

The first time you assess a new site, there won't be any trend data — that's normal. It takes at least two assessments before the system can show you trends.

## Tips

- **Same spot every time** — Stand at the same marker post each visit. Consistency matters more than perfection
- **Be honest** — Score what you actually see, not what you hope to see. The trends are what matter
- **Do all sites in the same week** if possible — this makes seasonal comparisons more meaningful
- **Morning is best** — Early morning visits let you see dew patterns, wildlife activity, and avoid heat of day
- **Bring your phone** — Take photos at each site and create a Photo Point record too
- **Don't overthink it** — If you're not sure between "Average" and "Good," pick whichever feels closer. The system works with approximate scores just fine
