# Reporting a Crop or Field Issue

Use this guide when you spot something in the fields that needs attention — pest damage, standing water, weed pressure, nutrient deficiency, or anything out of the ordinary.

## What You'll Need Before You Start

- **Which field** you're talking about (Field 1, 2, 3, or 4 — or describe the location)
- **What you saw** (in plain words — "yellowing leaves in the northwest corner," "standing water near the tile outlet," etc.)
- **When** you noticed it
- **How serious** it seems

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

Click on **"Issues"** at the top of the project page.

### Step 2 — Start a New Report

Click the green **"New issue"** button.

### Step 3 — Choose the Crop Issue Report

Find **"Crop Issue Report"** and click **"Get started"**.

### Step 4 — Fill In the Form

The title line at the top will start with `[CROPS]`. Just add a short name after it, like `[CROPS] Yellowing tomatoes in Garden Bed A`.

Then fill in the sections below:

- **Field Name/Number** — Which field is affected (e.g., Field 2, North 40, River Bottom)
- **Crop Type** — What's growing there (e.g., Tomatoes, Peppers, Squash, Greens)
- **Crop Stage** — How far along is the crop? (e.g., Seedling, Vegetative, Flowering, Mature)
- **Acres Affected** — Your best guess at how much area is affected
- **What did you observe?** — Describe what you see. Write it like you're telling someone over the phone:
  - "The tomatoes in Bed Group A are wilting. Looks like the whole row."
  - "Lots of weeds coming up between the squash rows near the fence."
- **Where in the field?** — Be as specific as you can (e.g., "low spots near the tile outlet," "along the south fence")
- **Weather conditions recently** — Has there been heavy rain, drought, frost, hail, etc.?
- **Possible Causes** — Check any boxes that might apply: pest damage, disease, nutrient deficiency, weather damage, herbicide drift, wildlife damage, or unknown. It's okay to check "Unknown" if you're not sure
- **Urgency** — Check one box:
  - Monitor: Keep an eye on it
  - Soon: Should investigate within the week
  - Urgent: Spreading rapidly or threatening yield
  - Emergency: Immediate action required
- **Photos** — If you took a photo with your phone, you can drag it into the form or click to upload it. Photos are really helpful but not required
- **Action Checklist** — You can ignore this for now. It's a list the team uses to track next steps after your report

### Step 5 — Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button.

### Step 6 — You're Done!

Your report is saved and visible to the whole farm team. The crop lead will get notified automatically.

## When to Use This vs. Just Telling Someone

Both are fine! But writing it down here has some advantages:

- **It doesn't get forgotten.** Verbal reports can slip through the cracks during busy weeks
- **It's dated.** You'll have a record of when you first noticed the problem, which helps with insurance claims, chemical timing, and tracking whether things got better or worse
- **Others can see it.** If someone else walks that field later, they can check here to see what's already been reported
- **Photos are saved.** That picture on your phone might get deleted accidentally — here, it's stored safely

## Tips

- You don't need to diagnose the problem. "Something doesn't look right in the south end of Field 1" is a perfectly good report
- If you can safely take a photo, include one. A picture is worth a thousand words, especially for plant diseases and insect damage
- Check back on your report later to see if someone has responded with a plan of action. You can add comments to the record if things change
