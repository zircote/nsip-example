# Reporting a Crop or Field Issue

Use this guide when you spot something in the fields that needs attention — pest damage, standing water, weed pressure, nutrient deficiency, or anything out of the ordinary.

## What You'll Need Before You Start

- **Which field** you're talking about (Field 1, 2, 3, or 4 — or describe the location)
- **What you saw** (in plain words — "yellowing leaves in the northwest corner," "standing water near the tile outlet," etc.)
- **When** you noticed it
- **How serious** it seems

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

Click on **"Issues"** at the top of the project page.

### Step 2 — Start a New Report

Click the green **"New issue"** button.

### Step 3 — Choose the Crop Issue Report

Find **"Crop Issue Report"** and click **"Get started"**.

### Step 4 — Fill In the Form

- **Title** — Give it a short name, like "Yellowing corn in Field 2" or "Weed pressure along south fence"
- **Field** — Which field is affected
- **Date Observed** — When you first noticed it
- **Description** — Describe what you see. Write it like you're telling someone over the phone:
  - "The corn in the northwest corner of Field 2 is turning yellow. It's about a 50-foot circle. The rest of the field looks fine."
  - "Lots of waterhemp coming up in the soybean rows near the ditch in Field 3."
- **Severity** — How bad is it?
  - Low: Worth noting but not urgent
  - Medium: Needs attention within the next week or two
  - High: Needs action soon — could spread or worsen
- **Photos** — If you took a photo with your phone, you can drag it into the form or click to upload it. Photos are really helpful but not required.

### Step 5 — Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button.

### Step 6 — You're Done!

Your report is saved and visible to the whole farm team. The crop lead will get notified automatically.

## When to Use This vs. Just Telling Someone

Both are fine! But writing it down here has some advantages:

- **It doesn't get forgotten.** Verbal reports can slip through the cracks during busy weeks
- **It's dated.** You'll have a record of when you first noticed the problem, which helps with insurance claims, chemical timing, and tracking whether things got better or worse
- **Others can see it.** If someone else walks that field later, they can check here to see what's already been reported
- **Photos are saved.** That picture on your phone might get deleted accidentally — here, it's stored safely

## Tips

- You don't need to diagnose the problem. "Something doesn't look right in the south end of Field 1" is a perfectly good report
- If you can safely take a photo, include one. A picture is worth a thousand words, especially for plant diseases and insect damage
- Check back on your report later to see if someone has responded with a plan of action. You can add comments to the record if things change
