# Recording a Soil Sample

Use this guide when your soil lab results come back and you need to record them in the system. You don't need to understand all the numbers — just enter what the lab report says and the system will track trends for you.

## What You'll Need Before You Start

- Your **soil lab report** (the paper or email from the testing lab)
- The **site ID** where the sample was taken (like P-01 or C-01)
- The **date** the sample was collected

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

At the top of the project page, click on **"Issues"**.

### Step 2 — Start a New Record

Click the green **"New issue"** button.

### Step 3 — Choose the Soil Sample Form

Find **"EOV Soil Sample"** in the list and click **"Get started"**.

### Step 4 — Fill In the Basic Information

- **Site ID** — Which site was sampled (like `P-01`)
- **Sample Date** — When the sample was collected (like `2026-09-15`)
- **Lab Name** — Who did the testing (like `Ward Laboratories`)
- **Sample Depth** — How deep the core was (usually `0-30 cm` unless you did something different)

### Step 5 — Enter the Lab Numbers

Look at your lab report and fill in whatever numbers you have. **You don't need to fill in every field** — just enter what your report shows:

- **Soil pH** — A number usually between 5.0 and 8.0 (6.0-7.0 is ideal for most plants)
- **Organic Matter (%)** — Higher is better. A healthy soil might be 3-5%
- **Organic Carbon (%)** — Related to organic matter. Higher means more carbon stored in soil
- **Bulk Density** — How heavy/compacted the soil is (lower is generally better)

**If you got a Haney Test:**
- **Water Extractable Organic Carbon (ppm)** — Measures the "food" available to soil microbes
- **Soil Respiration** — Measures how active soil microbes are (higher = more life)
- **Haney Soil Health Score** — An overall score from 0-50 (higher is better)

**If you got a CASH Test:**
- **Aggregate Stability (%)** — How well soil holds together (higher = better structure)

**Standard nutrients:**
- **Available Phosphorus (ppm)** and **Available Potassium (ppm)** — Plant nutrients

### Step 6 — Add Notes (Optional)

Note the test type, any unusual conditions when sampling, or questions you have.

### Step 7 — Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button.

## What Happens Next

The system will:
1. Compare your results to any previous soil samples from the same site
2. Show whether key metrics (organic matter, Haney score, etc.) are improving
3. Tell you where your soil falls compared to general benchmarks
4. Add the **"eov-enriched"** label when the analysis is ready

## What the Numbers Mean (Quick Guide)

| What the Lab Says | What It Means for Your Farm |
|---|---|
| Haney Score below 7 | Your soil biology needs help — more cover, less disturbance |
| Haney Score 7-15 | Acceptable — keep doing what you're doing |
| Haney Score above 15 | Good! Your soil is building health |
| Organic matter going up | Your land management is building soil — great sign |
| pH between 6.0-7.0 | Sweet spot for most crops and pastures |

## Tips

- **Same time each year** — Collect soil samples at the same time of year (fall is common) so results are comparable
- **Keep your lab reports** — The paper copies are good backup, but the system tracks everything digitally
- **Ask your advisor** — If the numbers are confusing, your farm advisor or extension agent can help interpret them
- **Don't expect instant change** — Soil health improves slowly. Year-over-year trends are what matter, not single results
