# Requesting an EOV Analysis

Use this guide when you want the system to crunch your ecological monitoring numbers — creating seasonal summaries, comparing sites, tracking trends, or checking if the farm is ready for Savory Institute enrollment.

Just like the flock analysis, **you fill out a form and the computer does the rest.**

## What Kinds of Analysis Can You Request?

| Analysis | What It Does | When to Use It |
|---|---|---|
| **Seasonal Summary** | Adds up all your site scores for one season and shows the big picture | After completing a round of seasonal assessments |
| **Site Comparison** | Puts your sites side by side so you can see which areas are healthiest | Anytime — helpful for planning where to focus improvements |
| **Annual Trend Report** | Shows how each site has changed over the year | At year end, to see the farm's trajectory |
| **Enrollment Readiness** | Checks whether you have enough data and good enough trends for Savory enrollment | When you're thinking about applying for EOV certification |

## Steps

### Step 1 — Go to the Issues Tab

At the top of the project page, click on **"Issues"**.

### Step 2 — Start a New Request

Click the green **"New issue"** button.

### Step 3 — Choose the EOV Action Form

Find **"EOV Action"** in the list and click **"Get started"**.

### Step 4 — Pick Your Analysis Type

Choose one of the four options from the dropdown.

### Step 5 — Select the Season (if applicable)

For Seasonal Summary, pick which season you want to analyze. For other analyses, you can leave this as "All" or pick a specific season.

### Step 6 — Enter Site IDs (Optional)

If you want to analyze specific sites, enter their IDs one per line:

```
P-01
P-02
C-01
```

**Leave this blank to include all sites** — that's usually what you want.

### Step 7 — Enter a Date Range (Optional)

If you want to limit the analysis to a specific time period, enter it here (like `2026-01 to 2026-06`). Otherwise, leave it blank and the system will use the most recent data.

### Step 8 — Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button.

## What Happens Next

The system will:
1. Read your monitoring data from previous Site Assessment records
2. Calculate scores, trends, and comparisons
3. Create a **report** with tables, summaries, and recommendations
4. Post a summary comment on your request

This may take a few minutes depending on how much data there is.

## Understanding the Results

The reports show your Ecological Health Index (EHI) — a single number that summarizes all 15 indicators:

- **Positive and rising** = your land is getting healthier (great!)
- **Positive and stable** = healthy and holding steady (good)
- **Declining** = some indicators are getting worse (worth investigating)

The reports also break things down by individual indicators so you can see exactly what's improving and what needs attention.

## Tips

- **Run a Seasonal Summary** after each round of assessments — it's the best way to see the big picture
- **Site Comparison** is great for identifying your weakest areas so you know where to focus management changes
- **Annual Trend Report** is your year-end report card — run it each December
- **Enrollment Readiness** needs at least 1 full year of data to be meaningful, so don't run it too early
- You can run analyses as many times as you want — each one creates its own separate record
