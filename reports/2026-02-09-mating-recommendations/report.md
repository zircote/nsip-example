# Mating Recommendations Report — 2026 Breeding Season

**Date**: February 9, 2026  
**Action**: Mating Recommendations — Optimal Sire Pairings  
**Breed**: Katahdin  
**Animals Analyzed**: 10 females (2 males excluded from mating analysis)  
**Database Last Updated**: November 21, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides mating recommendations for 10 Katahdin ewes from Beyond Blessed Farm for the 2026 breeding season. The ewes were evaluated for their genetic strengths and weaknesses, with recommendations focused on:

- **Growth traits** (WWT, YWT, PWWT) — critical for market lamb production
- **Birth weight management** (BWT) — to minimize lambing difficulties
- **Fertility** (NLB) — to maximize lambs born per ewe

The flock includes one proven sire (6402382024NCS310) with 25 progeny and high-accuracy EBVs. This ram is recommended as the primary breeding sire, particularly for ewes with lower growth potential.

## Ewe Profiles and Recommendations

### Group 1: High-Growth Ewes (Priority Retention Stock)

These ewes have exceptional growth traits and should be retained as the foundation of your breeding program.

#### 6401492025FLE087 — Top Growth Performer

**Date of Birth**: 3/2/2025  
**Status**: Maiden ewe (no progeny yet)

| Trait | Value | Accuracy | Breed Position |
|-------|-------|----------|----------------|
| BWT | +0.35 | 63% | 43rd percentile (slightly higher) |
| WWT | +3.07 | 61% | 66th percentile (above average) |

## Breeding Strategy Recommendations

### 1. Use of On-Farm Sire: 6402382024NCS310

**Profile**:
- **Proven sire**: 25 progeny, high accuracy (BWT: 80%, WWT: 78%, PWWT: 80%)
- **Key trait**: Negative BWT (-0.23) — critical for managing lambing ease
- **Moderate growth**: WWT +1.23, YWT +1.00, PWWT +1.94

**Best suited for**:
- Ewes with higher BWT (FLE087, FLE082, FLE047, FLE024)
- First-time lambing ewes (all FLE025 animals)
- Ewes where lambing ease is priority over maximum growth

**Predicted offspring quality**: 
- Easy lambing (low to negative BWT)
- Moderate to good growth
- Reliable outcomes due to high accuracy

---

### 2. External Ram Sourcing Strategy

For maximum genetic progress, consider acquiring an external ram for:

**Target profile**:
- **BWT**: -0.2 to +0.1 (lower for ewes with higher BWT)
- **WWT**: +3.0 or higher (to boost weaning weight)
- **YWT**: +5.0 or higher (for market lamb production)
- **PWWT**: +4.0 or higher
- **NLB**: +0.15 or higher (to improve fertility)
- **Accuracy**: 60%+ preferred (some progeny-tested data)

**Priority ewes for external ram**:
- 6401492022FLE002 — needs high-growth ram to compensate for her low EBVs
- 6401492025FLE087 — top growth ewe could benefit from elite ram to maximize offspring potential

---

### 3. Inbreeding Management

All recommended matings with 6402382024NCS310 have been evaluated for inbreeding risk. Key findings:

| Ewe | Relationship to NCS310 | COI | Status |
|-----|------------------------|-----|--------|
| 6401492025FLE011 | Same sire (NCS310) | N/A | **Avoid — father-daughter mating** |
| 6401492025FLE029 | Same sire (NCS310) | N/A | **Avoid — father-daughter mating** |
| 6401492025FLE008 | Same sire (NCS310) | N/A | **Avoid — father-daughter mating** |
| All others | Unrelated or distant | Low | **Safe to proceed** |

**Critical**: Three ewes (FLE011, FLE029, FLE008) are sired by NCS310 and **must not** be bred to him. These ewes require an external ram.

---

### 4. Trait Priorities for 2026

Based on flock analysis:

1. **Growth (WWT, YWT, PWWT)** — Top priority for market lamb production
2. **Birth weight management** — Several ewes have higher BWT; must use negative BWT sires
3. **Fertility (NLB)** — Flock average is below breed midpoint; needs improvement
4. **Accuracy** — Young ewes (born 2025) have lower accuracy; their EBVs may change with progeny data

## Breed Context — Katahdin Trait Ranges

| Trait | Minimum | Maximum | Midpoint | Flock Average (Ewes Only) |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|---------------------------|
| BWT | -0.89 lbs | 1.30 lbs | 0.21 lbs | +0.22 lbs (slightly high) |
| WWT | -3.02 lbs | 6.15 lbs | 1.57 lbs | +2.27 lbs (above average) |
| YWT | -9.50 lbs | 10.67 lbs | 0.59 lbs | +2.76 lbs (well above average) |
| PWWT | -7.10 lbs | 9.38 lbs | 1.14 lbs | +3.77 lbs (well above average) |
| NLB | -0.36 lambs | 0.69 lambs | 0.17 lambs | +0.09 lambs (below average) |

**Flock strengths**: Excellent growth traits (WWT, YWT, PWWT) — well above breed average.

**Improvement opportunities**: 
- BWT slightly elevated — continue using negative BWT sires
- NLB below breed midpoint — prioritize high-fertility rams in future acquisitions

## Action Items for 2026 Breeding Season

### Immediate Actions

1. **Do Not Breed** to 6402382024NCS310:
   - 6401492025FLE011 (daughter)
   - 6401492025FLE029 (daughter)
   - 6401492025FLE008 (daughter)

2. **Source External Ram** for:
   - Priority 1: Three daughters of NCS310
   - Priority 2: 6401492022FLE002 (low growth needs compensation)
   - Priority 3: 6401492025FLE087 (top ewe — maximize genetic progress)

3. **Breed to NCS310**:
   - 6401492020FLE249
   - 6401492022FLE002 (only if no high-growth ram available)
   - 6401492023FLE078
   - 6401492025FLE024
   - 6401492025FLE047
   - 6401492025FLE082
   - 6401492025FLE087 (if no elite ram available)

### Long-Term Strategy

1. **Ram Acquisition**: Budget for an external ram with target traits: BWT < +0.1, WWT > +3.0, YWT > +5.0, NLB > +0.15

2. **Ewe Retention**: Prioritize keeping FLE087, FLE082, FLE047, FLE024 — these are your top growth genetics

3. **Culling Consideration**: 6401492022FLE002 if high-growth rams not available — her low growth will drag flock average down

4. **Record Keeping**: Track lambing ease, weaning weights, and lamb survival for all 2026 offspring to update EBV accuracy

5. **Genetic Diversity**: Avoid overuse of NCS310 — aim for no more than 30% of 2026 lamb crop sired by any single ram

## Trait Glossary

- **BWT** (Birth Weight): Weight at birth in lbs. **Lower is better** — reduces lambing difficulties.
- **WWT** (Weaning Weight): Weight at ~60 days in lbs. **Higher is better** — faster early growth.
- **YWT** (Yearling Weight): Weight at ~12 months in lbs. **Higher is better** — key for market lamb production.
- **PWWT** (Post-Weaning Weight): Growth after weaning in lbs. **Higher is better**.
- **NLB** (Number of Lambs Born): Fertility trait — lambs per lambing. **Higher is better** — more lambs per ewe.

**Accuracy** indicates EBV reliability:
- < 40%: Low (no progeny data)
- 40-60%: Moderate (limited progeny data)
- 60-80%: High (good progeny data)
- > 80%: Very high (extensive progeny testing)

**Predicted Offspring EBVs**: Calculated as midparent values: `(sire_EBV + dam_EBV) / 2`
