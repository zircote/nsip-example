# Rank Animals Report — Weighted Trait Index

**Date**: February 7, 2026  
**Action**: Rank Animals — Weighted Trait Index Ranking  
**Breed**: Katahdin  
**Animals Analyzed**: 12  
**Database Last Updated**: November 21, 2025

## Summary

This report ranks 12 Katahdin sheep from Beyond Blessed Farm using a weighted trait index. Since no specific trait weights were provided, we used a balanced weighting scheme suitable for hair sheep:

- **BWT** (Birth Weight): -1.0 — Lower birth weight is preferred to reduce birthing difficulties
- **WWT** (Weaning Weight): 2.0 — Higher weaning weight indicates faster early growth
- **YWT** (Yearling Weight): 1.5 — Higher yearling weight for market lamb production
- **PWWT** (Post-Weaning Weight): 1.0 — Growth after weaning
- **NLB** (Number of Lambs Born): 1.0 — Fertility trait for maternal ability

**Score Formula**: `Score = Σ(trait_value × weight × accuracy / 100)`

The collection includes 10 females and 2 males. Most animals are young (born in 2025), with 6402382024NCS310 being a proven sire with 25 progeny and higher accuracy values.

| Trait | Minimum | Maximum | Midpoint |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|
| BWT | -0.89 | 1.30 | 0.20 |
| WWT | -3.02 | 6.15 | 1.57 |
| YWT | -9.50 | 10.67 | 0.58 |

## Recommendations

1. **Top-Ranked Females** (6401492025FLE087, 6401492020FLE249, 6401492025FLE082) show excellent growth traits and should be considered for retention as breeding stock.

2. **Proven Sire** (6402382024NCS310) ranks well with high accuracy values due to 25 progeny. The negative BWT and positive growth traits make this ram valuable for breeding.

3. **Young Stock** born in 2025 have lower accuracy values (36-65%) since they lack progeny data. Rankings may change as more performance data becomes available.

4. **Trait Trade-offs**: Animals with high growth (WWT, YWT, PWWT) tend to have higher birth weights. Balance selection pressure between growth and ease of lambing.

## Trait Glossary

- **BWT** (Birth Weight): Weight at birth in lbs. Lower values reduce birthing difficulties.
- **WWT** (Weaning Weight): Weight at weaning (~60 days) in lbs. Higher indicates faster early growth.
- **YWT** (Yearling Weight): Weight at ~12 months in lbs. Key for market lamb production.
- **PWWT** (Post-Weaning Weight): Growth after weaning in lbs.
- **NLB** (Number of Lambs Born): Fertility trait - more lambs per lambing.

**Accuracy** indicates reliability of the EBV:
- < 40%: Low reliability
- 40-60%: Moderate reliability
- 60-80%: High reliability
- > 80%: Very high reliability (extensive progeny testing)
