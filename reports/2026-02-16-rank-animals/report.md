# Rank Animals Report — Weighted Trait Index

Closes #5

**Date**: February 16, 2026  
**Action**: Rank Animals — Weighted Trait Index Ranking  
**Breed**: Katahdin  
**Animals Analyzed**: 12  
**Database Last Updated**: February 13, 2026  
**Sort Criterion**: WWT (Weaning Weight)

---

## Summary

This report ranks 12 Katahdin sheep from Beyond Blessed Farm and North Carolina State University using a weighted trait index, sorted by weaning weight (WWT) as specified. Since no specific trait weights were provided, we used a balanced weighting scheme suitable for hair sheep:

- **BWT** (Birth Weight): -1.0 — Lower birth weight is preferred to reduce birthing difficulties
- **WWT** (Weaning Weight): 2.0 — Higher weaning weight indicates faster early growth
- **YWT** (Yearling Weight): 1.5 — Higher yearling weight for market lamb production
- **PWWT** (Post-Weaning Weight): 1.0 — Growth after weaning
- **NLB** (Number of Lambs Born): 1.0 — Fertility trait for maternal ability

**Score Formula**: `Score = Σ(trait_value × weight × accuracy / 100)`

The collection includes 10 females and 2 males. Most animals are young (born in 2025), with 6402382024NCS310 being a proven sire with 25 progeny and higher accuracy values.

## Recommendations

1. **Top WWT Performers** (6401492025FLE087, 6401492020FLE249, 6401492025FLE047) show excellent growth traits and should be prioritized for retention. These ewes produce fast-growing lambs ideal for market.

2. **Proven Animals** (6401492020FLE249 with 6 progeny, 6402382024NCS310 with 25 progeny, 6401492022FLE002 with 5 progeny) have higher accuracy EBVs. FLE249 and NCS310 are the strongest proven performers.

3. **Birth Weight Consideration**: Animals ranking 1-4 by WWT all have above-average birth weights (BWT +0.24 to +0.47). While this correlates with good growth, monitor for lambing ease. Consider mating with low BWT sires like NCS310 (BWT -0.24).

4. **Proven Sire**: 6402382024NCS310 ranks 11th by WWT but has the most reliable data (80-81% accuracy). His negative birth weight combined with positive growth makes him an excellent breeding option despite lower ranking. Already successfully siring animals in this flock (3 daughters present).

5. **Young Stock**: Most animals born in 2025 have moderate accuracy (36-65%). Rankings may shift as more data becomes available.

6. **Fertility Leaders**: FLE011 (+0.18 NLB), FLE008 (+0.16 NLB), and FLE024 (+0.13 NLB) show best maternal characteristics.

7. **Cull Candidate**: 6401492022FLE002 shows negative growth across all weight traits and low fertility. Consider culling despite her low birth weight.

## Trait Glossary

- **BWT** (Birth Weight): Weight at birth in lbs. Lower values reduce birthing difficulties.
- **WWT** (Weaning Weight): Weight at weaning (~60 days) in lbs. Higher indicates faster early growth.
- **YWT** (Yearling Weight): Weight at ~12 months in lbs. Key for market lamb production.
- **PWWT** (Post-Weaning Weight): Growth after weaning in lbs.
- **NLB** (Number of Lambs Born): Fertility trait - more lambs per lambing.

**Accuracy** indicates reliability of the EBV:
- < 40%: Low reliability (limited data)
- 40-60%: Moderate reliability
- 60-80%: High reliability
- > 80%: Very high reliability (extensive progeny testing)
